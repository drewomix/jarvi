predicted to be greater than\\nan Air Quality Index value of 100 for the pollutant of Ground Level\\nOzone. The Air Quality Index, or AQI, was created as an easy way to\\ncorrelate levels of different pollutants to one scale.

People who may be especially sensitive to the effects of\\nelevated levels of pollutants include the very young, and those with\\npreexisting respiratory problems such as asthma or heart disease.\\nThose with symptoms should consider consulting their personal\\nphysician.\\n\\nFor additional information, please visit the New York State\\nDepartment of Environmental Conservation website at,\\nhttps://on.ny.gov/nyaqi, or call the Air Quality Hotline at\\n1 800 5 3 5, 1 3 4 5.\"\n          tags [\n            \"Air quality\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}",
